<h1>Apoo Tester</h1>

<p>The Apoo Tester is an environment to monitoring the execution of a
Virtual Processor Unit.  During the execution of a program, it shows
the contents of the program counter, registers and memory data. The
program in memory is displayed in an Assembly language (not in a
machine language). As is usual with processor units emulators, Apoo
has two memory segments: the program-segment and the data-segment. In
this way, both addresses for program instructions and data will begin
in 0.</p>

<h2>Execution</h2>

<p>When the Tester is called with a program file it tries to load and run
it.  If it fails it will display the error in the message line.  If a
"parsing error" occurs, during "Load" the interface will show the text
line in which the error occurred.</p>

<p>When the program is loaded (in memory) you can execute it in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Run:</b> will execute all the instructions</li>
<li><b>Step:</b> will execute the next instruction and the values of the
    program counter, registers and memory data will be updated; the
    next instruction line, if exists, will have the background
    white</li>
<li><b>Cont:</b> will execute instructions until the next breakpoint</li>
</ul>

<p>You may set or clear a breakpoint in an instruction by double-clicking (with the mouse)
on its line address number.</p>

<p>The button labeled Clear can be used to clear all breakpoints.</p>

<h2>Exit</h2>

<p>The Apoo Tester will not terminate until the caller terminates.</p>
